# 커뮤니티

## Technical committee

The Express technical committee meets online every two weeks (as needed) to discuss development and maintenance of Express,
and other issues relevant to the Express project. Each meeting is typically announced in an
[expressjs/discussions issue](https://github.com/expressjs/discussions/issues) with a link to join or view the meeting, which is
open to all observers.

The meetings are recorded; for a list of the recordings, see the [Express.js YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYjxjAeH6TRik9Iwy5nXw7g).

## Express is made of many modules

활기찬 커뮤니티에서는 매우 다양한 확장기능, [미들웨어 모듈](/{{ page.lang }}/resources/middleware.html)
및 상위 레벨 프레임워크가 개발되어 왔습니다.

Additionally, the Express community maintains modules in these two GitHub orgs:

- [jshttp](https://jshttp.github.io/) modules providing useful utility functions; see [Utility modules](/{{ page.lang }}/resources/utils.html).
- [pillarjs](https://pillarjs.github.io/): low-level modules that Express uses internally.

To keep up with what is going on in the whole community, check out the [ExpressJS StatusBoard](https://expressjs.github.io/statusboard/).

## Github Discussions

The [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/expressjs/discussions) section is an excellent space to engage in conversations about the development and maintenance of Express, as well as to share ideas and discuss topics related to its usage.
